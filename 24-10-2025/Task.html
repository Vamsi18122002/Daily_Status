  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h2>Data Structures GUI Application</h2>
  <p> This project is a Java-based GUI application designed to demonstrate and visualize the working of core data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, circular queues, and linked lists.
      Users can perform operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal with real-time graphical feedback. The goal was to help learners understand algorithmic concepts interactively.
      The interface was developed using <strong>Java Swing</strong> and <strong>WindowBuilder</strong> in Eclipse IDE. It emphasizes modular design, user-friendly interface, and efficient event-driven programming.
      Additional features include error validation, dynamic resizing, and responsive visualization panels.</p>

      Implemented <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> for communication between client and server, and integrated user authentication, product management, and order tracking functionalities.
      The project follows the <strong>MVC architecture</strong> and includes responsive UI design for better mobile and desktop experience.
